## Getting Started

| [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents) | [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents) |
|---|---|

1. Click `Open in GitHub Codespaces` or `Dev Containers` button above
2. Wait for the environment to load
3. Run the following commands in the terminal:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to select your Azure subscription and region
5. Wait for deployment to complete (5-20 minutes) - you'll get a web app URL when finished

For detailed deployment options and troubleshooting, see the [full deployment guide](./docs/deployment.md).
**After deployment, try these [sample questions](./docs/sample_questions.md) to test your agent.**

## Local Development

For developers who want to run the application locally or customize the agent:

- **[Local Development Guide](./docs/local_development.md)** - Set up a local development environment, customize the frontend (starting with AgentPreview.tsx), modify agent instructions and tools, and use evaluation to improve your code.

This guide covers:
- Environment setup and prerequisites
- Running the development server locally
- Frontend customization and backend communication
- Agent instructions and tools modification
- File management and agent recreation
- Using agent evaluation for code improvement

## Other Features
Once you have the agents and the web app working, you are encouraged to try one of the following:

- **[Tracing and Monitoring](./docs/other_features.md#tracing-and-monitoring)** - View console logs in Azure portal and App Insights tracing in Azure AI Foundry for debugging and performance monitoring.

- **[Agent Evaluation](./docs/other_features.md#agent-evaluation)** - Evaluate your agent's performance and quality using built-in evaluators for local development, continuous monitoring, and CI/CD integration.

- **[AI Red Teaming Agent](./docs/other_features.md#ai-red-teaming-agent)** - Run automated security and safety scans on your agent solution to check your risk posture before production deployment.

## Resource Clean-up

To prevent incurring unnecessary charges, it's important to clean up your Azure resources after completing your work with the application.

- **When to Clean Up:**
  - After you have finished testing or demonstrating the application.
  - If the application is no longer needed or you have transitioned to a different project or environment.
  - When you have completed development and are ready to decommission the application.

- **Deleting Resources:**
  To delete all associated resources and shut down the application, execute the following command:
  
    ```bash
    azd down
    ```

    Please note that this process may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

⚠️ Alternatively, you can delete the resource group directly from the Azure Portal to clean up resources.
